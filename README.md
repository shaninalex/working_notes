# Working notes

Instead of having a [pile of unusable code](https://github.com/shaninalex/random_code) I think it will be better to have a pile of more readable posts with code.

Site made with Hugo.

## work

```bash
# cloning
git clone git@github.com:shaninalex/working_notes.git
git submodule update --init --recursive

# run
hugo server

# run with drafts
hugo server -D

# create resourse
hugo new ./content/posts/xmpp-basic.md
```
